  <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>No Personal Data:</strong> Boli Development does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII). We do not collect your name, email, or contact details.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All calculations are performed locally on your device. This data never leaves your phone.</li>
    <li>
      <strong>Location Data:</strong> Apps may require your GPS coordinates to provide accurate data. This data stays on your device or in your iCloud. It is never sent to any other server, sold to
      third parties, or used for tracking.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>App Store & Payments:</strong> Premium features are handled entirely by Apple via StoreKit. We do not have access to your credit card or billing information.</li>
    <li><strong>No Analytics or Ads:</strong> Boli Development does not use third-party analytics (like Firebase) or advertising trackers. Your usage habits are private.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Because we do not collect your data, we have nothing to retain. Any locations you save within the app are stored locally or in your iCloud and are deleted if you uninstall the app, and clear your
    iCloud data.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Since no data is collected, there is no data to request or delete. You have full control over location permissions via your iOS System Settings.</p>

  <h2>5. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, contact the developer at <a href="mailto:trevor@boli.dev">trevor@boli.dev</a>.</p>
