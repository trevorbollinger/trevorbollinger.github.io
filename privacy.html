    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: January 20, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>At <strong>Horizons</strong>, we believe your location and daily habits are your business, not ours. This app is designed to provide sunrise and sunset information with maximum privacy.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Personal Data:</strong> Horizons does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII). We do not collect your name, email, or contact details.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Processing:</strong> All sunrise, sunset, and lunar calculations are performed locally on your device. Your data never leaves your phone.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> The app requires your GPS coordinates to provide accurate times. This data stays on your device. It is never sent to a server, sold to third parties, or used for tracking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>App Store & Payments:</strong> Premium features are handled entirely by Apple via StoreKit. We do not have access to your credit card or billing information.</li>
        <li><strong>No Analytics or Ads:</strong> Horizons does not use third-party analytics (like Firebase) or advertising trackers. Your usage habits are private.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Because we do not collect your data, we have nothing to retain. Any locations you save within the app are stored locally and are deleted if you uninstall the app.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since no data is collected, there is no data to request or delete. You have full control over location permissions via your iOS System Settings.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, contact the developer at: <br>
