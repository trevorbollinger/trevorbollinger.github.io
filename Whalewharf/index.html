      <p></p>
      <p>
        Whalewharf is a 2D RPG about observing a town evolve over time and shaping its outcome. Every decision, every quest, and every friendship echoes through generations, determining whether your
        town thrives as a trade hub or falls into ruin.

  <h2>Development</h2>
  <p>
    Whalewharf is a solo project developed by Boli Development. It is currently in early development and I have no idea how long this will take. A lot of what you see in the screenshots is still just
    placeholder. If you happen to stumble across this page, and you have a question, or just want to chat, feel free to email me at
