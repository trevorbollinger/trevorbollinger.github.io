        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>Whalewharf is a solo project developed by Boli Development. It is currently in early development and I have
            no idea how long this will take. A lot of what you see in the screenshots is still just placeholder. If you
            happen to stumble across this page, and you have a question, or just
            want to chat, feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:tralion@boli.dev">tralion@boli.dev</a>.</p>
